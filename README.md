# Hey there.

## Srijan is building things that look <span style="color:#fb923c;font-weight:bold;">good</span>

Iâ€™ve worked as a Founding Engineer on large-scale applications across  [enterprise accessibility](https://origin-www.veritas.com/en/uk/insights/ediscovery-platform), [early-stage womenâ€™s health](https://proactiveforher.com/), &  [agentic recruiting.](https://www.seekout.com/platform/spot)

I believe design is a decision that solves problemsâ€”and every decision should bring delight.

This [portfolio](https://www.srijansrivastava.com/) is that philosophyâ€”*in practice.*
